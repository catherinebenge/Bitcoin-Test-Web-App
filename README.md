Our web app has 4 main functions:

1. Makes/Manages user accounts (Create)
2. Post to Forum (Read/Create)
3. View User Directory (Read/Update/Delete)
4. View Historical Price Data (Read)

## Databases Used

Our Web App uses 3 databases each containing one collection.
1. collection 1 = users --> This collection is created by making an account and you can add to it by creating more accounts. You can also edit or delete documents in this database. 

2. collection 2 = bitcoin --> This collection was imported to the mongoDB database and used to display the bitcoin price data on page 4.

3. collection 3 = posts --> This collection is created when a user is selected and makes a forum post. All posts can be viewed on the forum page. 

## Conclusion

Thank you for reading our report! We hope you enjoyed the app.
